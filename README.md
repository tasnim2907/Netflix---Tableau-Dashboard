# Netflix---Tableau-Dashboard

## Project Overview
Here’s a Tableau dashboard that dives into Netflix’s catalog—movies and TV shows, all in one place. You’ll see how the content breaks down by year, country, genre, and rating. If you want to spot trends or just get a feel for what Netflix offers worldwide, this dashboard makes it simple.

## Key Features
The dashboard breaks things down into five main visuals:

   - Track how Netflix’s collection has changed over time.

2. **Total Movies & TV Shows by Country**  
   - Explore a world map to see which countries bring in the most content.

3. **Top 10 Genres**  
   - Find out what genres people watch the most.

4. **Movies & TV Shows Distribution**  
   - See the split between movies and shows in the catalog.

5. **Ratings**  
   - Dig into how content is divided by maturity ratings (think TV-MA, PG-13, R).
